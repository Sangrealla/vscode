I am an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin working on improving Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology for human contexts.  
AI is all around us. It lives in the core institutions of our society, telling workers what to do, determining which roads are build where, and influencing judges' court decisions. My research focuses on making AI more sensitive to human concerns and behavior, so that people can use algorithmic decisions not as decrees but rather as tools for more informed and fairer decision-making.  
In my approach to AI, I care deeply about both theoretical research and societal impact. Drawing from design, computer science, and social science, I create and deploy novel AI services in the field, working with real-world organizations. In this living lab, I study the psychological underpinnings of human-centered AI. With funding from NSF and Uptake, I have studied AI's impact on human workers and built AI services for nonprofits that serve people experiencing food insecurity and homelessness.
